[DONE] Todo: Quote: Convert spaces to %20
Then rewrite "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=TEXTGOESHERE"

[DONE] Todo: You should also have a random quote load upon initial page load,
and not just when button is clicked.

[DONE] Todo: Separate the random generator into its own function.
--> Can be further modularized, but for a simple app like this one,
current level of modularization is sufficient

[DONE] Todo: Refactor to convert jQuery calls to vanilla JS
--> Removed the "document ready" wrapper b/c no need to wait for other elements to load

[WONTFIX] Bug: In Firefox I get an "XML Parsing Error: syntax error"
when reading the JSON file.
Possible cause is that I'm loading a local file, not from a server.
Will need to test out on a server.
