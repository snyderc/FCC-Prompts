General map of to-dos:
[DONE] Get clickable board
[DONE] Handle generations
[] Present Generations count to user
[] Expose Settings to user (Start, Pause, Clear, etc.)
[] Allow generations to be advanced automatically instead of just manually
[] Have randomly generated starting pattern & auto-play that pattern
[] Handle different board sizes

Items to revisit later:

Board.scss: Update the width so it conforms with the board width
when the board X and Y are changed to different sizes.
(Variables, function to do the multiplication, etc.)

BoardCell.scss: I used @extend so that each BoardCell button
only needed one class. Might want to experiment with allowing
each button to have multiple classes -- one that's fixed and one
that changes depending on whether the cell is alive or dead.

GameOfLifeApp.js: Refactor HandleClearBoard so it and the random pattern generator
use the same function with different parameters passed in
