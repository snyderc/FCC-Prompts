# Projects I've Done Based on FreeCodeCamp Project Prompts

This repository contains projects I've worked on based on the project ideas from FreeCodeCamp.org.

Some projects were completed using the pre-2018 version of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, or are supplemental projects not part of the 2018 version's required projects. Those are located in the "Additional Projects" folder.

All projects are written in JavaScript, using various libraries and frameworks.
